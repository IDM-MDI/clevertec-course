The Baffin Basin is an oceanic basin located in the middle of Baffin Bay between Baffin Island and Greenland. With a maximum depth of over 2,700 m (8,900 ft), the basin represents the deepest point of Baffin Bay. The basin formed as a result of seafloor spreading at the time of the opening of Baffin Bay around 56 million years ago.[1]
